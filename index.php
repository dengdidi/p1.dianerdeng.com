<p><em>Diane Deng, Advertising Acrobat</em></p>
</br><p>
Born and raised a Bostonian, Diane graduated with a BS from Boston University in Communications with a specialty in Advertising. Aerodynamic Diane spends her spare time flying in the air through her practice of aerial yoga while pursuing her Masters in Computer Science focusing in Digital Media at Harvard. Not only is she a flying machine but a marketing machine as well. She recently launched her first national cross-promotional marketing campaign. When Diane is not gliding on yoga swings, she swiftly manages Temperature@lert's new media accounts while building client and affiliate relationships. For this airborne gal, she likes her temperature like she likes her aerial yoga, a warm 78 degrees.</p></br>

<p>************************************</p></br>

<p>I've been working as a freelance graphic designer for about three years, which is the exact amount of time I spent at Boston University's College of Communication. During those past 3 years, I have designed mainly for nightlife groups, ranging from venues needing some new loving in their clubs to promoters trying to make a quick buck off their 24/7 partying friends.</p>

<p>So besides graphic design, I want to advertise. I can write pretty clever/witty copy. It's not all brain-farts in this mind. I also am extremely well-versed in the world of guerrilla/promotional marketing. Yes that's right, you're looking at a Nantucket Nectar Juice Guy and Tony the Tiger! I have worked as a promotional model for about four years and I can definitely help grow that part of the company.</p>

<p>If these stories of my past experiences in my very random working fields have not amused you enough to ask me for an interview, here's a few more examples of why you should:</p>

<li>I have been Buster the Bunny for a WGBH Zoom charity event</li>
<li>I get paid to graffiti on girls (it's called Shriiimpin')</li>
<li>I believe I have an innovative way to make money off social media</li>
<li>I have an amazing recipe for fried chicken!</li>

<p><em>Specialties:</em>complete understanding of Adobe CS4, designing effective campaigns, able to work under pressure, able to adapt, knowledgeable in both MAC & PC platforms, branding & identity, guerrilla marketing, building brand awareness, pitching to new business, building reports, media planning, social media expert, PowerPoint expert designer</p>
